<p>
  Welcome! Thank you for stopping by. This is my playground of random little things that I found that helps me learn what overlooked simple problems computers can solve. The answers could be somewhere out there, in pieces or multiple versions. My goal here is to organize my thoughts of what I found helpful. It is all a constant learning experience, shared here. With love.

  I am working on curating a <a href="/nostr-news-feeds">list of news RSS sources</a> that are set up as public Nostr identities and may be followed by anyone. I think it is important to choose what journalism sources we may want to keep up with, conveniently in our Nostr feed.
