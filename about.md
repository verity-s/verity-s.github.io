title: About me
---

I am a curious tech enthusiast, with the goal of finding the most simple and beautiful solutions to the little things that get overlooked or just don't receive much attention. Where some more imagination is in order. And perhaps some shell or Python scripting.

For example, I loved assigning functions to some obscure keyboard keys that can be used for something useful (e.g. the Magic keyboard Eject key or the right option key; or how to create a shortcut to paste text without its default copied formatting).

When I saw how limited my T-Mobile home internet gateway settings are, I used it as an opportunity to learn Python as well as more shell scripting to view and change the useful hidden settings in as little clicks as possible in the command line.

It's a great journey and I love every step along the way. Thank you for encouraging me and pushing me to work harder with your sponsorship!
