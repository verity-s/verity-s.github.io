title: Search, search and search again
---

I sometimes need to check everywhere for, let's say, remnants of a deleted program (all sorts of preference files and anything else). It's time to simplify the whole system search with a quick shell script.

Jumping right to it, here is my script:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/verityj/1baf59b95a7da5f03a44ce0620a4253d.js"></script>

To use it, basically place it anywhere you like and in the Terminal issue:
```sh
$ chmod +x search.sh
    # The above command makes the script executable, 
    # so the following command can be run:
$ ./search.sh something

Searching everywhere for "*something*" (case-insensitive) ...

$
```

To this script, it does not matter if you capitalized anything, it will find it. Letter case does not matter.

If you find it useful and want to make it more convenient, you could move the script into `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

For an even easier use, I renamed it to just `search` (from `search.sh`) - less to remember. Now I can happen to be in any directory on the computer and still search everywhere for files and directories that match the symbols I give it.
