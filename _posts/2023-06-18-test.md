title: Testing markdown reference lists
---

Reference lists is what I am used to, so let's experiment what works.

I already know that a reference is created if I type `[^1]` in the main text and at the bottom the reference as `[^1]: Source`. Then in the main text the code renders as [^1].

Does it work as the example in the [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links)?

Main text reference: `[hobbit hole][^1]`. And that becomes: [hobbit hole][^1].

What if the main text reference was just `[1]`? Test: [1].

## References

[^1]: After a colon and a space, the reference text goes here. (Ref for `[^1]`)

[1]: After a colon and a space, the reference text goes here. (Ref for `[1]`)
