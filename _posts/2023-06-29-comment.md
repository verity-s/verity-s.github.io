It took me a while to understand how to add a comment section underneath a post without the standard Disqus.

## Nostr

The most interesting way is using [NoComment], available on GitHub. It is made by the creator of the Nostr protocol, fiatjaf. I find it a very convenient way to allow anyone to add a comment as a Nostr account is not needed, or any log ins or permissions. 

Another advantage is that I can link the comment section to a Nostr post that I made about the post. Any comments left under that post show up on Nostr on the note thread. That may be a disadvantage as well, as the optional note ID that links to a specific thread on Nostr goes inside the comment script, of course. That means the script gets added manually to each post, if I want to add the `data-custom-base="note1..."` field to the script - which I do! 

## GitHub

Another way is by adding a GitHub app [Utterances]. There are a few steps to configure it, which starts with installing Utterances on the blog repository. To edit and view all the installed apps click on your username on the very top right of the GitHub page and select _Settings_. Look at the long list on the left of the page and scroll to _Applications_. Utterances will be there, and its _Repository access_.

One thing that confused me is how to set up the script for my repository. The instruction just says

```
repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]"
```

OK, I understand to delete everything between the quotes. What goes in there seems to be in the format of `owner/repo` so in my script that line for this blog is

```
repo="verityj/verityj.github.io"
```

That seems to work. Every other setting can be left as default. I was able to add Utterances to each post by adding the script to the post layout html file.
