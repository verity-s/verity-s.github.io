title: Eject key - it is easily changeable!
---

There is a way to assign any function to the Magic Keyboard Eject key, after all. No software to install, nothing much to mess with. Just a simple key assignment. I could not find that _anywhere_ online so I had to go back to the basics.

First, let's understand what the `eject` key means. It is a _consumer one shot control (OSC)_ key. Its official function is _"OSC - removes media from the player"_.Reference [^1]

Remember, it still has specific roles in two shortcuts: `command (⌘)` - `option` - `eject (⏏)` puts the computer to sleep, and `command (⌘)` - `control` - `eject (⏏)` will close all open apps and reboot without asking you. Once you change what `eject` does, these system shortcuts will not work.

Here is a command that uses `hidutil` command. Takes in the eject key as source and assigns forward delete as the destination:

```
$ hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":
    [{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0xC000000b8,
      "HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x70000004c}]
}'
    # Output of the above command:
UserKeyMapping:(
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771148;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 51539607736;
    }
)
$ hidutil property --get "UserKeyMapping"
    # shows existing user key maps
(
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771148;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 51539607736;
    }
)
```

At this point, the magic keyboard eject key is actually a delete forward key. Until your next reboot.

If you would like to remove all user key mappings set above:
```
$ hidutil property --set '{"UserKeyMapping":[null]}'
UserKeyMapping:(
)
$ hidutil property --get "UserKeyMapping"
    # shows existing user key maps
    # now there are none:
(
)
```

## Surviving through reboots

This setting is cleared during a reboot. Which is a good thing if you just want to test a key map or don't always use the same keyboard or whatever the situation may be. 

- You could create a Terminal command alias to execute the above command when you need it.
- You could create an Automator script that executes that shell command and click to run it under the "Services" menu.
- You could assign an Automator script shortcut as [previously discussed]({% post_url 2023-06-13-toggle-wifi %})
- Or, you could have that command run on user login:

User specific launch agents live in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` directory.[Reference [^2]] If you don't have one, create it.

Inside, create a property list file. Let's call it `com.local.keyremap.plist`

Here are the full contents that I use of that file (it's all just plain text):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/verityj/f54e1467859596ef36a87e14cdce54b6.js"></script>


(You could also use an online plist generator that has most keys available.[Reference [^3]]

If you notice, I am using **two** key bindings. The first source is the `eject (⏏)` key, the second source is the `right option` key. Both destinations (meaning key functions) are `forward delete`. The reason for this is that I don't always use a Magic Keyboard. My Mac built in keyboard does not have the eject key, but it does have a rarely used right option key. So I added that option as well. I find it super convenient.

Once you create the above file, `System Settings` may show a notification that `hidutil` has been added to your `Login Items`. That makes sense, it will be executed when you log in.

Reboot to see that all is functioning as intended. Or launch the service manually

```
$ launchctl start com.local.keyremap
```

After a reboot, check what keys are mapped:
```
$ hidutil property --get "UserKeyMapping"
(
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771148;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 51539607736;
    },
        {
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst = 30064771148;
        HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc = 30064771302;
    }
)
```

Success! We have two forward delete keys. Or whatever you set using the example key definitions above. There is an Apple developer page going into detail on key remapping.[Reference [^4]]

Have fun with it! Assign some other destination key for the mighty `Eject`. This completely avoids installing anything (and by that I mean [Karabiner, covered previously]({% post_url 2023-06-07-eject-button %})). You are in control.
