title: Testing markdown reference lists
---

I am very familiar with listing references throughout an article. Then it is easy to refer to the same source, if needed. What are the options here? Let's experiment.

I know that a reference is created if I type `[^1]` in the main text and at the bottom the reference as `[^1]: Source`. Then in the main text the code renders as [^1].

Does it work as the example in the [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links)?

Main text reference: `[hobbit hole][^1]`. And that becomes: [hobbit hole][^1]. Not useful.

## Reference at page bottom

[^1]: After a colon and a space, the reference text goes here. (Ref for `[^1]`)
