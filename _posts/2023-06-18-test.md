title: Testing markdown reference lists
---

I am very familiar with listing references throughout an article. Then it is easy to refer to the same source, if needed. What are the options here? Let's experiment.

#### Version 1 markdown: proper reference list

```
Main text: [^1] ... [^2] ... and so on
Bottom: 
[^1]: Source 1 text and links
[^2]: Source 2
```

A reference is created if I type `[^1]` in the main text and at the bottom the reference as `[^1]: Source`. Then in the main text the code renders as [^1]. The page will number all references and produce a list at the end.

#### Version 2 with just links

Does it work as the example in the [markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links)?

Main text reference: `[hobbit hole][2]`. And that becomes: [hobbit hole][2]. But now that `[2]` can be any string, as long as at the bottom I include just the link, with maybe a title so it looks like `[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles I"`. Now the `[hobbit hole]` above becomes a link to wikipedia.

Or I could skip the two parts and just type `[hobbit hole]` by itself in main text. Then on the bottom define it as `[hobbit hole]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles II"`. That works, too: renders as [hobit hole] and works as a link.

**Note**: the "title" above just means that text will pop up when hovering over the link. It can be added to the inline regular link as well: `[link with title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles III")`. Rendered look: [link with title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles III"). 

[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles I"

[hobbit hole]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles II"

### Reference list from version 1 at page bottom

[^1]: After a colon and a space, the reference text and/or link goes here. (Source for `[^1]` in main text)
