I am a growing self-taught programmer, with the goal of finding the most simple and beautiful solutions to the little things that get overlooked or just don't receive much attention. Where some more imagination is in order.

For example, I loved assigning functions to some keyboard keys I noticed I could use for something more useful (e.g. right option key or eject key or how to create a shortcut to paste text without its copied formatting).

When I saw how limited my T-Mobile home internet gateway settings are, I used it as an opportunity to learn Python as well as more shell scripting to view and change the useful hidden settings in as little clicks as possible in the command line.

It's a great journey and I love every step along the way. Thank you for encouraging me and pushing me to work harder with your sponsorship!
